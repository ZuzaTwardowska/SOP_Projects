## Overview
This repository consists of four seperate projects:
- [Graph simulation with pipe and fifo](#graph)
- [Message Queues](#message)
- [Quiz with TCP](#quiz)

## Graph simulation with pipe and fifo

Program consists of the management process and verticles' processes. Communication between processes
is implemented with pipes. Fifo file is used by the management process to communicate with user that can execute commands:
- print - prints all of the edges in the graph
- add x y - adds (directed) edge from verticle x to verticle y
- conn x y - returns information whether there exists any connection from verticle x to verticle y (direct or indirect)

## Message Queues

Generator creates (or uses existing) message queues q1 and q2. If queues does not exist and need to be created, it publishes 
to q1 n (optional argument) messages with its pid and 3 random characters. If argument n was given but queues with given names exist,
generator ends with an error. During its cycle, generator reads messages from q1 and generates a new message by adding five 
random characters to the original message. After t seconds of sleep, the new message is sent to q2 with p% likelihood and the 
original message is sent back to q1.

Processor reades messages from q2, sleeps for t seconds, and prints out the message. Then it changes the message by replacing the pid with its
own pid and first three random characters with '000' (for example 1234/abc/hjklm => 5678/000/hjklm). The changed message is sent back to q2
with p% likelihood.

The messages generated by the generator have a higher priority for processor then those genereated by processor programs.
Multiple generators and processors may use the same message queues.
Processors waits for messages at most one second - if no messages have been read during this time, processor prints out 
the latest message it has read.
